  <h1>Kratos</h1>
  <img src="img/God-of-War-III.webp" alt="Kratos, son of Zeus.">
  <p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(God_of_War)">Kratos</a>, son of zeus and the ghost of sparta. He is the protagonist inside a video game
    series called God Of War.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <p>Three things I admire about Kratos</p>
    <li> Arch story, his story begins by his brother being kidnapped. He then goes
      on a hunt to avenge his brother.
    </li>
    <li class="color">
      Beating death, Kratos do not die, he is not like us
      instead he fights death and beats it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Family man. Even though he has killed his father, wife and kids, he has
      gone through change for the better. In the new games, kratos get another
      son where he tries to slay the demons from the past and becomes a
      loving family man that sets killing as his last resort.
    </li>
  </ul>
